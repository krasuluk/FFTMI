# FFTMI
This repository includes the implementation of the objective quality metric described in the paper:

L. Krasula, K. Fliegel and P. Le Callet, "FFTMI: Features Fusion for Natural Tone-Mapped Images Quality Evaluation," in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, vol. 22, no. 8, pp. 2038-2047, Aug. 2020, doi: 10.1109/TMM.2019.2952256.

If you use our method in your research, please, cite the above stated paper.


A simple example of usage is also included. The images come from our TMQID database [1], while the original HDR image is a part of Fairchild's HDR dataset [2]. The main thing to note is that the HDR image is expected to be scaled to physical luminance as done in the TMQID database.
